Bootstrap your decentralized applications by delegating the tedious and repetitive task of wallet connection and button design to this plugin.

Provides a ready-made and fully-customizable UI button and utility functions for connecting to a web3 wallet (MetaMask). It has built-in Typescript support and supports Dark mode.

The button takes care of displaying the user's wallet address, their identicon / avatar and pending transactions.  
Utility functions for connecting to a MetaMask wallet are provided. More wallets can be added in the future as per public request. Feel free to contribute yourself!

# Getting started

This plugin uses `vue-demi` to support both Vue 2 and Vue 3, but usage in Vue 2 is prone to issues, so **Vue 3** is the recommended version of vue for this plugin.

## Installation

Use Yarn or npm to install the library **vue-connect-wallet**.

```console
yarn add vue-connect-wallet
```

```console
npm install vue-connect-wallet
```

## Registering the component

In the `main.js` file, import the styles.

```js
import "vue-connect-wallet/dist/style.css";
```

Then, you can either register **ConnectWalletButton** as a global component or specifically import it in the components you need (recommended).

To register as global component, in your `main.js`:

```js
import VueConnectWallet from "vue-connect-wallet";
createApp(App).use(VueConnectWallet).mount("#app");
```

To import individually (recommended):

```js
import { ConnectWalletButton } from "vue-connect-wallet";
export default {
  components: {
    ConnectWalletButton,
  },
};
```

**\*Note**: If using &lt;script setup&gt;, you only need to import the component without registering it.\*

# Usage

## Button component

If the `address` is **empty** or doesn't start with **0x**, the "Connect Wallet" button will be shown. If an address is provided, it will instead display the identicon and the sliced address.

### Simple usage

```html
<ConnectWalletButton address="0x00" />
```

### Advanced Usage

```html
<ConnectWalletButton
    address="0x00"
    :txnCount="0"
    :dark="false"
>
    <!-- Override the default text on the "Connect Wallet" button -->
    Connect Wallet!

    <template #pending>
        <!-- Override the blue pending transaction div -->
    </template>

    <template #spinner>
        <!-- Use your own Spinner (svg, css, image, etc.) -->
    </template>

    <template #identicon>
        <!-- Use your own identicon library. Jazzicon is the default -->
    </template>

    <template #connectWalletButton>
        <!-- Use your own button for the "Connect Wallet" state when no address is provided -->
    <template>

    <template #addressButton>
        <!-- Use your own button to display the address when address is provided. Does not remove the pending transaction div -->
    </template>
</ConnectWalletButton>
```

## MetaMask Utils

Provides functions to easily connect to a MetaMask wallet, get accounts and listen to changes when an account is changed and when a chain/network is changed.

```js
import { useMetaMaskWallet } from "vue-connect-wallet";

const wallet = useMetaMaskWallet();
```

Utilities provided in `useMetaMaskWallet`:

```ts
/** Returns boolean value indicating if MetaMask is detected on the browser **/
wallet.isMetaMask: boolean;
/**
 * Returns account address array if wallet is connected otherwise opens MetaMask popup.
 * On error, returns a single string with the error message
 */
wallet.connect(): Promise<string | string[]>;
/**
 * Get all connected accounts addresses. Returns an empty array if none connected
 * On error, returns a single string with the error message
 */
wallet.getAccounts(): Promise<string | string[]>;
/**
 * Opens a MetaMask popup to connect/disconnect from a list of user's accounts. Returns an array.
 * The popup opens even if the user has already connected some accounts.
 * On error, returns a single string with the error message
 */
wallet.switchAccounts(): Promise<string | string[]>;
/**
 * Add a token to MetaMask
 * @param symbol Symbol of the token, upto 5 characters
 * @param address Address of the token
 * @param imageURL String URL of the token image
 * @param decimals (Optional) 18 by default
 * @param type (Optional) ERC20 by default
 */
wallet.addTokenToWallet: (symbol: string, address: string, imageURL: string, decimals?: number, type?: string) => Promise<void>;
/**
 * Switch to a chain or add the chain if the user does not have it
 * @param chainId ChainID as an Integer
 * @param chainConfig (Optional) Chain Config Interface used for adding new chain
 */
wallet.switchOrAddChain: (chainId: number, chainConfig?: ChainConfig | undefined) => Promise<void>;
/**
 * Event handler for when the user changes the account in MetaMask
 *
 * Reference for event handlers: https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html#events
 * @param callback Function that takes accounts string array as an argument
 */
wallet.onAccountsChanged: (callback: (accounts: string[]) => void) => void;
/**
 * Event handler for when the user changes the active chain in MetaMask
 *
 * Reference for event handlers: https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html#events
 * @param callback Function that takes chainId number as an argument
 */
wallet.onChainChanged: (callback: (chainId: number) => void) => void;
```

# Example

Example usage in Vue 3 with Typescript, using &lt;script setup lang="ts"&gt;:

```ts
import { useMetaMaskWallet } from "vue-connect-wallet";

const address = ref("");
const wallet = useMetaMaskWallet();

wallet.onAccountsChanged((accounts: string[]) => {
  console.log("account changed to: ", accounts[0]);
});
wallet.onChainChanged((chainId: number) => {
  console.log("chain changed to:", chainId);
});

const connect = async () => {
  const accounts = await wallet.connect();
  if (typeof accounts === "string") {
    console.log("An error occurred" + accounts);
  }
  address.value = accounts[0];
};

const switchAccount = async () => {
  await wallet.switchAccounts();
  connect();
};

const isConnected = async () => {
  const accounts = await wallet.getAccounts();
  if (typeof accounts === "string") return false;
  return accounts.length > 0;
};
```

# Contributing

Conribution in any area is welcome. Adding support for new wallets would be very much appreciated.

To develop in this repo, just clone it and run `yarn` to install all the dependencies. Look at the `package.json` to understand the scripts.

# Miscellaneous

**Note on Identicons (Jazzicon)**  
This package comes with the Jazzicon from the library [vue3-jazzicon](https://github.com/samuveth/vue3-jazzicon). Installing it as a dependency in the plugin raised import errors due to which I bundled the component in this plugin itself.

# Author

Hi! I am Neelansh Mathur. I am a freelancer specializing in Frontend development for Blockchain applications, and currently studying Computer Engineering. You can find out more about me at my social links.

I made this plugin because I was having to repeatedly use the same code and redesign buttons for every dApp I develop for. This has made my life easier and I hope it does the same for you ðŸ’š.
